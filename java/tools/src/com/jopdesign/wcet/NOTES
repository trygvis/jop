Misc. Notes on the wcet08 project
---------------------------------
[Bytecode modifications performed by com.jopdesign.build] com.jopdesign.build runs a set of
bytecode modifications. The question is, how do we ensure that we take the same set of
modifications into account ? Should we run all of them ? Related: How should the analyser interact
with the optimizer ?

[Method references] Suggestion: Add MethodRef (a pair of classinfo and methodId) to 
com.jopdesign.build. 

[Setting MethodGen] Problem with methodGen + visitMethod():
Whenever setMethod is called, MethodGen is deleted.
This leads to a subtle bug: After e.g. replacing iinc , we have to create the MethodGen again.
And if we run e.g. ReplaceIinc after DFA analysis, the analysis is lost !
